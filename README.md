# DataSpark
Data.SparkFun Python API
--------------------------
Python API for use with [data.sparkfun.com](https://data.sparkfun.com).

Whats the point???:
Useful for logging any sort of data to a cloud immediately. For example, if you had Raspberry Pi monitoring temperature
via a sensor, you could integrate DataSpark to log a temperature point immediately to data.sparkfun.com. The main
benefit of this is that you have a much smaller chance of losing any precious data because each data point is immediately
being sent to the SparkFun servers.

Alternatively, you could also set up your own Phant server if you don't want to send data to the SparkFun servers.

See SparkFun docs for more info on how http requests are made:

Also look at "example.py" for more info on how to use DataSpark.
